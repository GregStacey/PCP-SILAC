# PCP-SILAC
Bioinformatics pipeline for analyzing PCP-SILAC and other co-elution experiments. Original versions of the analysis were written by Anders Kristensen<sup>1</sup> and Nichollas Scott<sup>2</sup>.


# How to use

### 1. Download pipeline.

In a browser, go to to [https://github.com/fosterlab/PCP-SILAC](https://github.com/fosterlab/PCP-SILAC). Click the green "Clone or Download" button in the top right. Then click "Download ZIP".

### 2. Format your data.

#### csv files
This pipeline is designed to work on multiple csv files. Each file contains data from a single biological condition and one or more replicates. For example, data from a PCP-SILAC experiment with M/L and H/L ratios would be formatted into two csv files.


### 3. Organize your files.

### 4. Run analysis.
